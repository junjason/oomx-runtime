## üß© Overview
This repository demonstrates a **dynamic runtime architecture** that converts traditional **Object-Oriented (AoS)** simulation code into **matrix- and Structure-of-Arrays (SoA)** representations, executing them efficiently on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

The system unifies **data layout transformation**, **runtime scheduling**, and **adaptive re-tiling** into one coherent engine.  
It began as a **Matrix-Based Game State Management System** and evolved into a **general-purpose Dynamic SoA Runtime** for parallel processors and high-volume transactional workloads.

> ‚öôÔ∏è *In essence:* a V8-style managed runtime that continuously restructures memory for coalesced, divergence-free execution on data-parallel hardware.

## üß† Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **OO‚ÜíMatrix Translation** | Converts compiled OO (Array-of-Structs) loops into a field-wise matrix or SoA form using LLVM/MLIR analysis. |
| **Dynamic SoA Runtime** | Monitors workload divergence (branch efficiency, active/inactive ratios) and re-tiles data at runtime with hysteresis control. |
| **Schema / Store / Sow Model** | A minimal ECS-like data engine: Schema defines fields, Store holds tiled SoA data, and Sow buffers deterministic writes. |
| **Pipeline API** | Functional pipeline (map/reduce) for per-tick or per-frame kernels, compatible with deterministic or in-place update modes. |
| **Cross-Domain Embodiments** | Gaming physics, particle systems, and financial micro-batch simulations all run on the same runtime. |

## ‚ö° Why It Matters

Traditional simulation engines and financial batch systems still rely on **object trees and pointer-chasing loops**.  
This design breaks down on modern parallel hardware:

- GPUs execute thousands of threads in warps; branching and irregular memory layouts kill throughput.  
- CPUs with wide SIMD units suffer from low occupancy and cache misses.

The Dynamic SoA Runtime addresses both by:
- **Restructuring memory on the fly** to maintain warp coherence,
- **Compactly representing entities as columns** instead of heap objects,
- And **executing updates in tiled vectorized kernels**.

Early CPU benchmarks already show **30 %+ p95‚Äìp99 latency improvement** compared to baseline OO implementations.  
GPU benchmarks are in progress to quantify additional gains in branch efficiency and energy reduction.
